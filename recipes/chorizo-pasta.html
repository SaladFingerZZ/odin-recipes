        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 links of chorizo, casing removed</li>
            <li>1/4 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 small zuchini, sliced and quartered</li>
            <li>6 oz dried pasta </li>
            <li>Hot chicken or beef stock, water works too just enough to cover pasta</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>50 g milk + 5 g cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 slices american cheese</li>
            <li>28 g white sharp cheddar cheese, grated</li>
            <li>28 g chipoltle gouda, grated regular gouda works too</li>
            <li>Cilantro to garnish</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Place stock(or water) in a pot on medium-high heat or warm in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Slice the onion and quarter the zuchini.</li>
            <li>Set a pan over medium-high heat and add chorizo. Break apart with spatula until ground chorizo is formed,
                cook until done. Transfer into a bowl, keep as much fat in the pan as possible.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and zuchini to the pan, cook for 3 minutes stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove and add the onions and zuchini into the same bowl as the chorizo.</li>
            <li>Add dried pasta to pot, cover with just enough stock or water to cover the pasta. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook until pasta is al dente, add more liquid as needed if it reduces too quickly. When pasta
                is finished the stock should be significantly reduced into a sauce like consistency.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to low. Add the milk and cornstarch slurry. Stir in until the sauce
                comes together. Stir in the cheeses until thickened to your liking.</li>
            <li>Add the chorizo and vegtable mixture, stir to combine. Serve with cilantro on top.</li>
          </ol>
